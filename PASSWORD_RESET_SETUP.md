# Password Reset Flow Setup Guide

## Overview
The password reset flow has been successfully implemented with the following components:

1. **Login Page** (`/login`) - Added "Forgot your password?" link
2. **Reset Password Request Page** (`/reset-password-request`) - Users enter email to request reset
3. **Reset Password Page** (`/reset-password`) - Users set new password after clicking email link

## Supabase Configuration Required

### 1. Update Redirect URLs in Supabase Dashboard

Go to your Supabase project dashboard → Authentication → URL Configuration and add these URLs:

**Site URL:**
- `http://localhost:3000` (for development)
- `https://nexsellpro.com` (for production)

**Redirect URLs:**
- `http://localhost:3000/reset-password`
- `https://nexsellpro.com/reset-password`
- `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`
- `https://nexsellpro.com/auth/callback`

### 2. Email Templates (Optional)

You can customize the password reset email template in Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Email Templates → "Reset Password".

## How It Works

1. **User clicks "Forgot your password?"** on login page
2. **User enters email** on reset request page
3. **Supabase sends email** with reset link
4. **User clicks link** in email (redirects to `/reset-password`)
5. **User sets new password** and is redirected to login

## Security Features

- ✅ Email validation
- ✅ Password strength requirements (8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, numbers)
- ✅ Password confirmation matching
- ✅ Token validation on reset page
- ✅ Automatic redirect after successful reset
- ✅ Error handling for invalid/expired links

## Testing

1. Start the development server: `pnpm dev`
2. Go to `/login` and click "Forgot your password?"
3. Enter a valid email address
4. Check your email for the reset link
5. Click the link and set a new password

## Troubleshooting

### Infinite Loop Issues
- Fixed by adding proper cleanup in `useEffect` hooks
- Added loading states to prevent multiple auth checks
- Used `mounted` flag to prevent state updates on unmounted components

### Email Not Received
- Check spam folder
- Verify email address is correct
- Check Supabase email settings
- Ensure redirect URLs are properly configured

### Reset Link Not Working
- Verify redirect URLs in Supabase dashboard
- Check that the link hasn't expired (default: 1 hour)
- Ensure you're using the exact URL from the email
